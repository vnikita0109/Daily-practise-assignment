ans-a,b,c

Consider the code
private static void printTotal(int i, int j) {
int sum = i + j;
System.out.println("This program performs addition " +
"using two numbers supplied.");
System.out.println("The two numbers and the sum: " +
i + " + " + j + " = " + sum);
}

ans-a

Consider the code:
// This program prints text and an integer number.
public class YearPrinter {
public static void main(String [] args) {
int year= 2013;
System.out.println("This year is: " + year);
}
}
Which of the following are correct of the above code:
    • a) “year” is a numeric variable.

System.out.println("a+b = " + c);
return c;
}
b.
String a = "Java";
String b = "programming";
String c = "Java programming";
if (c.equals(a + b)) {
System.out.println("Java programming"); // prints Java programming
}
c.
{
Object object = null;
}
d.
Integer i = null;
try {
i = new Integer("56");
}
catch(NumberFormatException nfe) {

ans-a,b,c,d

Consider the code
public class YearPrinter {
public static void main(String [] args) {
new YearPrinter().printIt();
}
private void printIt() {
int year= 2013;
System.out.println("This year is: " + year);
}

}
Which one of the following is correct after the above is compiled and run:
    • a) There is a compile time error.
    • b) The program prints “The year is: 2013”.
    • c) There is a runtime error.

ans-b

Consider the code
package mypackage;

public class ClassA {
public static void main(String [] args) {
new ClassA().doThis();
}
public void doThis() {
System.out.println("Running the ClassA class.");
}
}
Assume that the ClassA.java is in the current directory. And, all the Java commands are run from the current directory. Which of the following are correct:

    • a) The command “javac -d . ClassA.java” at command prompt creates a directory called mypackage, and ClassA.class file within that directory.
    • b) The above class can be run at the command prompt using the command “java mypackage.ClassA”.
    • c) The above class can be run at the command prompt using the command “java ClassA”.
    • d) The above class can be run at the command prompt using the command “java ClassA.class”.

ans-a,b

True or false:

ans-true

Consider the following two Java classes
ProgramA.java:

import java.util.ArrayList;
public class ProgramA {

public static void main (String [] rrr) {
ArrayList<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
list1.add("element 1");
System.out.println("An element is added to the array list.");
}
}

ProgramB.java:

public class ProgramB {

public static void main (String [] args) {
java.util.ArrayList<String> list = new java.util.ArrayList<String>();
list.add("element 1");
System.out.println("An element is added to the array list.");
}
}
Which of the following are correct of the above two classes:
    • a) Both ProgramA and ProgramB compile, run and print “An element is added to the arraylist .”.
    • b) Only ProgramA compiles, runs and prints “An element is added to the arraylist .”.
    • c) Only ProgramB compiles, runs and print “An element is added to the arraylist .”.
    • d) Both ProgramA and ProgramB fail to compile and run.
